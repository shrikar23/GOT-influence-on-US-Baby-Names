# GOT-influence-on-US-Baby-Names
Goal:
To analyse the effect on Game of Thrones character Names on the Baby names across United States of America.

Data:
The Dataset US Baby Names was taken from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names). The data set contains count of all baby names in US from 1910 to 2014. 
I will be working on a subset of this data set. 
Since Game of thrones series first season was aired in 2011, the subset contains baby names from 2008 to 2014.

Analysis: Used R to create the necessary data set. Used SAS programming to perform the needed Analysis. Used Tableau to perform Data Visualization.
